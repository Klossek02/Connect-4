# Connect-4
Connect 4 Game Project with Machine Learning implementation.

# Objective 
The main motivation for creating such game was my dear boyfriend who wanted to play another game apart from playing chess. As the idea has been progressing, I was considering not only simple implementation of the code with basic board, as well as "X" and "O" symbols imitating players, but also was thinking about adding enhanced GUI resembling the real game, as well as creating an AI opponent to improve the experience and the overall gameplay. 

# Rules 

## Materials
We need a 6 x 7 grid, with 42 checkers (21 of each colour, in other words dedicated to each player).
## Objective
To be the first player that gets 4 checkers in a row.

## Game Description
1. Set up the grid so both players can reach it. Make sure the lever is set right so checkers won't fall through.
2. Decide on the checker colors each player will use and determine who starts the game.
3. Take turns putting the checkers into the grid until someone gets four in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
4. The first person to get four in a row wins! The winner clears the grid by moving the lever and letting the checkers drop out.
